# Tools Installer

This is re-post of my <a href="https://gist.github.com/AndyNotfound/0a6a60dd6e2c8f981a1b2373cfb524d7">GithubGist</a> 4 years ago when I started coding on Termux. Please ignore my "Past self" stupidness. I was excited about hacking and penetration back then.

## Where can I run these script?
I'm very sorry to dissapoint you, but this tools is <code>only usable on Termux</code>, you can't run this on Arch (I use Arch too btw), Fedora, Slackware, or even Gentoo without changing the script. <b>You can run this</b> if you change the package manager for example <code>pacman -S instead of apt install</code>.
<br>
## How to run this tools?
<ul>
  <li>Please make sure you have these things :
    <ul>
      <li>Termux <code>the latest the version is the better</code></li>
      <li>Internet <code>obviously</code></li>
      <li>Git, you can check it by typing <code>git --version</code></li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Clone this repository by typing <code>git clone https://github.com/AndyNotfound/ToolsInstaller.git</code></li>
   <b>Note :</b> if you haven't installed git, you can type <code>sudo apt install git</code> to install it (if you're using apt package manager).
   <li>Navigate to the cloned directory by doing <code>cd ToolsInstaller</code></li>
   <li>Run the tools by summoning it like this <code>sh ToolsInstaller.sh</code></li>
</ul>

## Why this tools even exist?
To make things easier for you, new security and penetration enthusiast or some script kiddie out there to explore more things with ease, because <b>this tools contains a lot of tools usable for just that</b>.
