## Where can I run these script?
I'm very sorry to dissapoint you, but this tools is <code>only usable on Termux</code>, you can't run this on Arch (I use Arch too btw), Fedora, Slackware, or even Gentoo without changing the script. <b>You can run this</b> if you change the package manager for example <code>pacman -S instead of apt install</code>.

  <li>Please make sure you have these things :
    <ul>

    </ul>
   </li>

</ul>
